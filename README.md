This is  a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. 
The output  corresponds to the correct grade, as shown below:

 B - 60 to 79, 
 C - 59 to 49, 
 D - 40 to 49, 
 E - less 40.
The functions checks the range of the marks entered and assigns the correct grade to the  marks entered

## Speed Detector

This has been refferenced to the KRA(kenya)



## Development
1.creat a new repository
2.Creat a new  folder for each function(The folder should have atleast 2 files the index.js and the file where the function exists)
3.Create the function. 
4.Export the function to index.js to ensure the two are linked.
5.Run the function using node index.js to see if theya are working
5.Add the changes to the repository using 'git add .'
6.Commit the changes
7.Then push the changes to reflect on your repo.
